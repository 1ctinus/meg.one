## Emby

### <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What is it?

Emby is similar to Plex, but (in my opinion) looks much nicer and works significantly better. It allows you to stream movies, TV, and music from my server to your device.

Available content:

- Over **450 movies**
- Nearly **40 TV shows** with over **6,000 episodes**
- Over **7,000 songs** from over **150 artists**

If I am missing a movie or show, just ask. Most movies can be added within **1-2 hours**. TV shows take a bit longer because of the number of episodes. *Older movies or shows may not be available*.

**Plex has been shut down**. Any requests to [plex.jmoore.dev](https://plex.jmoore.dev) will redirect to Emby. The Plex app will no longer work.

### <i class="fas fa-mobile"></i> Apps

- [Android][2]
- [iOS][3]

In the app, skip Emby Connect sign in and manually specify a server using the address and port listed above.

### <i class="fas fa-download"></i> Downloads

Downloads within the iOS and Android app are currently broken unless you are on my WiFi. I have a workaround for this which involves installing a **VPN profile** on your device. Please ask if you want access to downloads.

### <i class="fas fa-share"></i> Sharing

Please **do not** share your login with anyone else! My internet upload is pretty bad, so more people having access means the whole thing will be slower for everyone.

### <i class="fas fa-signal-alt"></i> Data usage

Movies and TV shows can easily be **transcoded** to a lower quality to be able to stream them faster without buffering. This is enabled by default when outside my WiFi network.

Music, however, takes a lot longer. Most of the music files are called "FLAC" files which is simply an extremely high quality audio format. A typical MP3 file from a YouTube music video is around five megabytes, but most of my FLAC files are anywhere between **40 and 200 megabytes**. They can be converted on demand for easier streaming, but this takes some time. Don't stream audio over mobile data!!
