//-
	_global.pug is only meant for loading things
	in includes/ so that other files don't need
	to specify what they need to include. Instead,
	they can include _global since the same is
	easy to remember and it essentially does the
	same thing. As well, typically only files in
	pages/ should include this.

include includes/_variables
