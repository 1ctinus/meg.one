### Degoogle <a href="https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle" target='_blank'><i class="fab fa-github" id="icon"></i></a>

The [Degoogle](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle) project started in **Mid 2018** and is ongoing to this day. What originally started out as a [request for a megathread](https://web.archive.org/web/20190910044130/https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/8l3vjy/can_we_get_a_megathread_on_breaking_away_from/) turned into an actual megathread (link no longer available), eventually making it's way to the [r/privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/de-google). A year after the first thread, I made a [new thread for 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190727004453/https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/byzq4w/megathread_cutting_google_out_of_your_life_2019/). This one had a bunch of new rules on what could be added as an alternative. The project is now maintained through [GitHub](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle) but the Reddit wiki still acts as a mirror.

Recent initiatives (late May/early June 2020) are automating the project and attempting to make it easier to edit. Instead of directly editing the README.md file, all replacement data (and most other sections) are now in Yaml files. These files are read by a build script that generates the README. This makes sure everything looks consistent and allows for faster editing. There is another script that publishes the newly generated README to the r/privacy wiki.

As of June 5, 2020, the project has **over 3200** stars on GitHub. You can view the guide in a number of places, such as [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle#readme), [GitHub Pages](https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/) (using my own subdomain), the [r/privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/de-google), and [other mirrors](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle/blob/master/MIRRORS.md).
