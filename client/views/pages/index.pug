	p My name is Joshua Moore and I am a Bachelor of Science student majoring in Computer Science at MacEwan University in Edmonton Alberta. I am a self-taught full stack web developer with a passion for open source projects (in fact, this entire website is #[a(href='https://github.com/tycrek/jmoore.dev') open source]!)
